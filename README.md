# Electric_Car_Research
The point of this project is to help an Electric car-sharing service company to be able to understand its clients' car usage over time

For this research, I specifically want to find out the following : 
1. Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
2. What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
3. What is the most popular station?
4. Which postal code is the most popular for picking the electric Blue car.
